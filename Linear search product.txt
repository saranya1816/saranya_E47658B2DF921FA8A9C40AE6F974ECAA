Write a function called linear_search_product that takes the list of products and a target product name as input. The function should perform a linear search to find the target product in the list and return a list of all occurrences of the product if found,or an empty list if the product is not found.
def linear_search_product(product_list, target_product):
    occurrences = [product for product in product_list if product == target_product]
    return occurrences
def linear_search_product(product_list, target_product):
    occurrences = [product for product in product_list if product == target_product]
    return occurrences
